        My name is Krzysztof and I began my coding journey with JavaScript
        around 1 year ago. Seeing the results of my work in the DOM and being
        proud of what I learned made me fall in love with coding. After mutliple
        days of studying for 12 hours, I finally feel confident enough to send
        rÃ©sumÃ©s ðŸ˜„.

        The possibilities of web development are incredible, which is why I have
        also recently started learning the back-end to be able to create
        amazing, fully-fledged apps. I simply love learning about web
        development and I hope I will be able to show my passion to you.
