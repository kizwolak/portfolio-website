        My name is Krzysztof and I began my coding journey with JavaScript
        over 2 years ago. Seeing the results of my work in the DOM and being
        proud of what I learned made me fall in love with coding. After mutliple
        days of studying for 12 hours, I finally felt confident enough to send
        rÃ©sumÃ©s ðŸ˜„.
        <br />
        <br />
        My only commercial experience so far is in SQL and C#, but I've learnt so much
        about web development and computer science as a whole. 
        I feel like I found my dream career and I would love to be able to continue
        working hard on growing as a developer.
        <br />
        <br />
        I'm looking for a team where I can make a difference. I'd like to be able to
        help many users to enjoy a continuously improved experience using 
        the best technology. I'm an easygoing and reliable person - I'm sure I'll fit in!
